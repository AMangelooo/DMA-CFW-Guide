# DMA-CFW-Guide
The following guide details instructions on the creation of modified DMA (attack) Firmware based on [pcileech-fpga](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech) **version 4.13**. <br />
**Additionally this is intended to be a build off of garagedweller's [UC thread](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/anti-cheat-bypass/613135-dma-custom-firmware-guide.html) guide in a more detailed way**<br />

#### üìñWhy make this guide?
I know how tedious reading through pages of threads and documentation can be to make some relatively minor changes such as this,
additionally, it doesn't help that there are people intentionally being vague and keeping information secret, or even misleading 
people to push them to buy their +$100 "highly custom undetectable" firmware.

#### üîé Definitions
UC
: Unknown Cheats

ACs
: Anti Cheats

DMA
: Direct Memory Access

TLP
: Transaction Layer Packet

DSN
: Device Serial Number

DW
: Double Word | DWORD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
- (Don't expect this to work for Vanguard, Faceit, ESEA, or other such ACs that are as 'sophisticated' as they are. <br />
Also, this guide does ___not___ detail how to set up software or change computer settings to accommodate DMA cards)

- It is assumed that the user following the guide has a basic understanding of custom firmware ...  **Finish this list** ... 

- It is not our fault if you brick your computer / DMA card.

## **1. Requirements**


#### Download all of the following
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) Will need to make an AMD account to download
- [Pcileech-fpga](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech-fpga) Source code for custom firmware
- [Arbor](https://www.mindshare.com/software/Arbor) Will need to make an account to download the trial (14 days)




## **2. Gathering the donor information** 
(Using a donor card will help us later on with TLP emulation to communicate with the device to start a driver for legitimacy) <br />
Due to my limited testing and knowledge, I'll be using a network adapter for all examples continuing <br />
<sup>(I welcome any contribution about utilising different hardware for this)</sup>

It is suggested to use a cheap piece of hardware to get the IDs and then throw it out. These are used to emulate the DMA card. **So don't get the IDs of any existing hardware in your computer and plug them into the firmware. ACs will detect 2 of the same IDs and flag it** 

### Using Arbor
Go into Scan Options under the Local system tab and Press Scan/Rescan, the values selected by default are good enough for us.
Go Into PCI Config and locate your network controller, scroll around in the decode section and take note of the following things:

#### All IDs shown below are mine and might not be the same for you


1. Device ID // 16 bits

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/8baec3fe-c4bd-478e-9f95-d262804d6f67)


2. Vendor ID // 16 bits

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/39c7de6d-d8db-4744-b0a0-ddeca0dfd7d7)


3. Revision ID (will show as RevID) // 8 bits

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/c2374ea7-ca9c-47b7-8a8d-4ceff5dffe3b)


4. BAR0 (Also click on this value and take note of the sizing value)

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/19239179-057a-4ed5-a79f-45cf242787a5)

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/59a08249-1ce3-49ae-ac98-00e9909ca8e3)

My size is 16kb so record that

5. Subsystem ID // 16 bits

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/94522a95-70bd-4336-8e38-58c0839e38ad)



6. DSN(listed as Serial Number Register) // 32 bits each | 64 bits combined

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/595ae3e2-4cd8-4b3d-bcfa-cf6a59f289d5)

It's fine if the Device Serial Number Capability Structure is not shown. use these numbers

Serial Number Register (Lower DW): `00 00 00 00`, // 32 bits

Serial Number Register (Upper DW): `00 00 00 00`, // 32 bits

Combed lower and upper registers: `00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` // 64 bits

To combine your lower and upper registers you add them to make 1 64 bit register 

The combined DSN register is what's used for DSN configuration in step 3

In my case, these are my values:

Serial Number Register (Lower DW): `68 4C E0 00` // 32 bit

Serial Number Register (Upper DW): `01 00 00 00` // 32 bit

Lower DW + Upper DW = `68 4C E0 00 01 00 00 00` // 64 bits

Thus the combined lower and upper registers is: `68 4C E0 00 01 00 00 00` // 64 bit

7. 

We will still need Arbor later for our 0x40 and 0x60 blocks but it'd be convoluting to explain it here so keep it open

## **3. Initial Customisation**
Once again due to limited knowledge, I'll be focusing on the PCIeSquirrel section of ufrisk's pcileech at the moment, sorry to those using other cards.

### Using Vivado
1. Open Vivado and in the top menu, in the search query, search for tcl console and click on it.

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/5a3770ad-b821-49c1-bea8-a79684993abc)

The console should now open at the bottom of the application.

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/ae96df35-3e46-4f55-8ffd-39b42c8d0972)


2. In the Tcl console, type in `pwd` to see the working directory. It should look something like this `C:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/Xilinx/Vivado`

3. cd back a few times and then cd to the PCIeSquirrel folder in the pcileech-fpga-4.13 project folder. It should look something like this `C:\Users\user\Desktop\pcileech-fpga-4.13\PCIeSquirrel`. (Desktop is where my project folder is)

4. Once you have PCIeSquirrel dir open, in the Tcl console type in `source vivado_generate_project.tcl -notrace` and wait for it to finish
5. Once the project has been generated, Vivado should automatically open the `pcileech_squirrel.xpr` file. Keep it open on the side for a bit.

### Using Visual Studio
1. Open the PCIeSquirrel folder and head to this file `/src/pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv`. Within this file use Ctrl+F and search the file for `rw[20]` which should be on line 209 to find the master abort flag/auto-clear status register. Change the accompanying 0 to a 1 along with the accompanying `rw[21]`.

2. In the same file `pcileech_pcie_cfg_a7.sv` Ctrl+F `rw[127:64]` which should be on line 215 to find your DSN field listed as `rw[127:64]  <= 64'h0000000101000A35;    // cfg_dsn`, insert your Serial Number there as such `rw[127:64]  <= 64'hXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;    // cfg_dsn` preserving the 16-character length of the input field, if your DSN is shorter, insert zeroes as seen in the example image<sub>(I think as long as its not the hard code value PCIleech comes with you should be fine as that's what ACs would scan for, please correct me if I'm wrong though.)</sub>

this being my DSN

if your donor card didn't have a DSN, yours should look like

`rw[127:64]  <= 64'h0000000000000000;    // +008: cfg_dsn`


3. Now head to `/src/pcileech_fifo.sv` and Ctrl+F `rw[203]` which should be on line 290 and change the `1'b1;` to `1;b0;` (This will allow us to change the config space bytes later down the line)

4. Go ahead and save all the changes you've made

## **4. Vivado Project Customisation**
1. Once inside Vivado, navigate to the "sources" box and navigate as such `pcileech_squirrel_top` > `i_pcileech_pcie_a7 : pcileech_pcie_a7` then double click on the file with the yellow square labelled `i_pcie_7x_0 : pcie_7x_0`.

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/5617a8f8-6d5a-44af-8f88-703bc7d1f101)

2. You should now be in a window called "Re-customize IP", in there, press on the `IDs` tab and enter all the IDs you gathered from your donor board, also note that the "SubSystem Vendor ID" Is just the same as your Vendor ID. _(If your donor board is different from a network adapter you may have to adjust some settings in the "Class Code" section below as well.)_

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/4b0584ec-9dda-4a2a-a5e1-a6e2eb28c6d1)

To check the class code of your donor card go back to Arbor > scan if needed, else > PCI config > set PCI view to Linear. Your card should be highlighted in green. There will also be a column header called **Class**. match that with your card.

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/24131586-03d6-4b70-9000-16448a4d8944)

3. Also go into the "BARs" tab and set the size value you gathered in step 2, note that the Hex Value shown is not meant to be the same as your bar address. You cannot edit this value.

![image](https://github.com/Silverr12/DMA-CFW-Guide/assets/89455475/1942fa3c-71cf-4466-a9a6-a33b5b38e54d)

the size of my bar was 16kb so 16kb is what you set it as

If the size unit is different change the size unit to accommodate the unit of the bar size



4. Press OK on the bottom right then hit "Generate" on the new window that pops up and wait for it to finish.
5. We will lock the core so that when Vivado synthesises and/or builds our project it will not overwrite some things and to allow us to manually edit some things we could only do through the interface before, to do this, navigate to the "Tcl Console" located in the top right of the bottom box and enter into there `set_property is_managed false [get_files pcie_7x_0.xci]`, (to unlock it in the future for any purposes use `set_property is_managed true [get_files pcie_7x_0.xci]`.)

## **5. Blocks 0x40 and 0x60**
1. Still in Vivado, navigate to `pcie_7x_0_core_top` as shown in the image, and use the magnifying glass in the top left of the text editor to search for these different lines to match them to your donor card
  (Disclaimer, you are matching the bytes by capability & structure, not by block, for example, Vendor ID is a structure, whereas PCIe is a capability that is made up of many structures)

- In comparison with a paid custom firmware versus pcileech default, we have recorded changes in the following blocks (grouped by dword, 1 indicates a change, 0 indicates no change)
  - 0x00 `SKIP-IDS 00000100 01100010 00000000` Header
  - 0x40 `11110000 00000001 00000000 00000000` PM Capability
  - 0x50 `00100000 11111001 00000000 00000000` MSI Capability
  - 0x60 `00100000 00000111 00000101 00001101` PCIe Capability
  - 0x90 `00010001 00000000 00000000 00000000`PCIe Capability

## **6. TLP Emulation**
** TODO: Still need to find out which exact values to change + new pcileech PIO BAR support needs research

## **7. Building and Flashing <sub>only for squirrel</sub>**
-explain vivado generate bitstream<br />
-what file to go to for .bin file<br />
-either link users to https://docs.lambdaconcept.com/screamer/programming.html or explain it all here

In regards to flashing, if you mess up your cfw and your bios wont post/hangs/whatever else doesn't allow your main pc to fully boot while your dma card is slotted in, if its still powered (indicated by the green lights) you can flash new firmware onto it from your second computer, if your second computer doesnt recognise the dma card, im 90% sure its dead, if your first computer wont' stay powered on, you have to buy a riser of sorts that will allow you to power your dma card but without it communicating
