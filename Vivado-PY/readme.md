### Automatically change Basic IDs without touching Vivado

#### Before you run the files, edit them with your IDs and file locations
Steps
1. Put the 3 files in the same directory
2. Run generate-project.py | Let this finish
3. Run Vivado.py

once Vivado.py has run. The Ids will have changed. 

I will continue to update this to include more customisations

> [!NOTE]
> This doesn't create the .bin file. you will need to open the xpr file in /PCIeSquirrel/pcileech_squirrel and generate the file within Vivado.
